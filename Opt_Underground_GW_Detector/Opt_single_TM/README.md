# Underground Optimization:

This folder contains the scripts used to produce the plot in the paper:  [Optimization of seismometer arrays for the cancellation of Newtonian noise from seismic body waves](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ab28c1).

`1ch` and `3ch` contains the scripts for the optimization of arrays with seismic sensors having respectively 1 or 3 channels of measurement. `Rayleigh` contains the script for optimizing the sensors for a surface detector with the hypothesis of only Rayleigh seismic waves distribuited in an isotropic and homogeneus manner.
