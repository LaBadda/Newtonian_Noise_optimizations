#Surface GW Detector - Data-driven optimization

This folder contains the scripts to run the seismic sensor optimization that were used in the following publication: [Machine learning for gravitational-wave detection: surrogate Wiener filtering for the prediction and optimized cancellation of Newtonian noise at Virgo](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/abab64).

#How to use: 

First run `Script1.py`, then use `LaunchScript2.sh` to run `Script2.py` in the proper way. Then run `Stitch.py` and then the true final optimization: `Script3_opt.py`
